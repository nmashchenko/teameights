# teameights.com
🦉 This is platform for developers to find each other.

# Stack of technologies that we will be using for this project:

**Front-End:** <br>
⭐️	ReactJS (functional) <br>
⭐️  MaterialUI / Styled Components
⭐️	Redux <br>

 **Back-End:** <br>
⭐️	NodeJS <br>
⭐️	MongoDB <br>
⭐️	DevOps:	Undetermined <br>

**Design:** <br>
⭐️ Figma 

# Idea

🎧 Overall idea - platform for student developers (probably skilled also) to find each other and work together on pet projects/real projects from project pool of customers (will be available only for skilled teams), tournaments between them will determine skill level, etc. Also possible mentorship, premium projects, AI code review, etc. basic functionality is described below.

# Responsiveness
The application should be *responsive* (e.g. should be available both on mobile phones and desktops).

Approximate widths for different devices:

📱	Desktops 1440px <br>
💻 Mobiles 375px <br>

# Colors

This list will be constantly updating, and you will be always able to see the design on figma:

https://www.figma.com/file/QaEUKYrZnVUEOzMBBSd7Q3/team8s?node-id=0%3A1

If you want to know why teameights.com or team8s.com – I don’t know, I just think this sounds cool =)

The application will be built in two different parts, first one will be landing page with all of the information about our platform, with a lot of ‘get started’, ‘sign up’, etc. buttons that will redirect user to the sign-up/sign-in page and then will transfer him to the platform in case of successful login

# Roles

There will be several different roles on platform, for example:

⚜️	Default user <br>
⚜️	Premium user <br>
⚜️	Mentor user <br>
⚜️	etc. <br>

*In short, the idea is for now: default user will be able to search for teammates, won’t be able to add ask for mentor for his team, won’t have access to premium projects, etc. (this list will be extending during our calls). 
Premium user, obviously, will be able to ask for mentor for his team and will have access to premium projects, probably also with some additional features (like deadline management, impact management, etc.).*

**Finally**, mentor user will be a person who is not interested in finding teammates but rather will be able to mentor some teams that are looking for him and he will be able to help multiple teams simultaneously with their questions, etc.

⚠️ **TODO: Add incoming invite page here**
</p>
We might redesign some pages but for now they should exist in any form, also we might add some additional pages later.

# Team
Regarding the team members as for now:

🧑🏻	Nikita (full-stack dev) <br>
🧑🏻	Mitya (designer) <br>

Even though all of us are seniors, some of us have experience in developing real-world projects. Personally, I believe this idea is amazing and is 1) helping people, 2) could be monetized easily, 3) will give us some real-world experience as students, 4) can potentially give us an opportunity to found company and work on this full-time.

*Regarding the roles for this project, if you want to work more on back than on front let me know, same works for other way. Nikita (me) will lead the project and assign tasks / keep healthy environment / check deadlines (we can use scrum methodology if you guys know it) *

However, if you want to contribute for both front and back you are more than welcome! Be prepared that this project will be coding-heavy, and you will probably have to learn a lot of new things beside university material, I will be with you and help as much as I can with any bugs, material, etc.

We will also do code reviews to maintain the large code-base and 1 on 1 sessions if you will have any questions

# Plan

The plan for now is:

1️⃣	Do first meetings to discuss and assign roles for this project as well as understand the deadlines and requirments

2️⃣ Introduce the codebase we have now to the new team members and start the learning process of side technologies.

3️⃣ Understand how git works/merging branches/making new branches/making pull requests/etc.

4️⃣ Try to write and implement some new code for the existing codebase

5️⃣ Refactor old code to write it in more clear and understandable way

(P.S) Nikita ❤️
