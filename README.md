# teameights
🦉 This is platform for developers to find each other.

# Stack of technologies that we will be using for this project:

**Front-End:** <br>
⭐️	ReactJS for basic structure (functional) <br>
⭐️  MaterialUI/Tailwind/something else for CSS (or probably styled-components with default CSS) <br>
⭐️	Redux <br>

 **Back-End:** <br>
⭐️	NodeJS <br>
⭐️	MongoDB <br>
⭐️	DevOps:	Undetermined <br>

**Design:**
⭐️ Figma 

(P.S.) There are some concerns regarding typescript, we have to discuss this all together since I am personally not familiar with it at all and I have experience with developing projects on clear JS but if you all want to use TS for more secured development I will totally support this

# Responsiveness
The application should be *responsive* (e.g. should be available both on mobile phones and desktops).

Approximate widths for different devices:

📱	Desktops 1440px
💻 Mobiles 375px

# Colors

Colors is undetermined yet, however as for now (not final) we will be using:

📌	Main BG: #E5E5E5
📌	Subcolor #1: #D6D6D6 (inputs/dropdowns)
📌	Subcolor #2: #121111 (different blocks or cards background)
📌	Subcolor #3: #E0FF00 (some of the buttons)

This list will be constantly updating, and you will be always able to see the design on figma:

If you want to know why teameights.com or team8s.com – I don’t know, I just think this sounds cool =)

The application will be built in two different parts, first one will be landing page with all of the information about our platform, with a lot of ‘get started’, ‘sign up’, etc. buttons that will redirect user to the sign-up/sign-in page and then will transfer him to the platform in case of successful login

# Roles

There will be several different roles on platform, for example:

⚜️	Default user
⚜️	Premium user
⚜️	Mentor user
⚜️	etc.

*In short, the idea is for now: default user will be able to search for teammates, have only one team, won’t be able to add ask for mentor for his team, won’t have access to premium projects, etc. (this list will be extending during our calls). 
Premium user, obviously, will have more teams, will be able to ask for mentor for his team and will have access to premium projects, probably also with some additional features (like deadline management, impact management, etc.).*

**Finally**, mentor user will be a person who is not interested in finding teammates but rather will be able to mentor some teams that are looking for him and he will be able to help multiple teams simultaneously with their questions, etc.

# Pages

Regarding the paging, currently we are 100% sure that this list of pages will exist (**green** – *page exists*, **red** – *under development*):

✅	Developer profiles page (whenever user login, signup he will be redirected to this page). Regarding this page we are still deciding whether it is more logical to add people to this page whenever he will register or allow him to add himself manually) but you can check the design on figma (it is on the right side named ‘profiles’) and suggest something
✅	Developer page (it will pop-up as a modal window whenever user will click on developer from the list) and will provide all information about the developer and also will contain button ‘invite to team’
✅	Tournaments page (it will display upcoming tournament information and winners of the past tournament, if you want to see how it looks like you can check it in figma ‘tournaments’)
❌	Upcoming tournament page (here teams will be able to see description of the tournament, prize pool, start date, and will be able to sign-up for it if there will be enough slots, we will decide maximum amount of slots later, this page is not ready yet on figma)
❌ Top teams tributes page (here we will display top teams, their earnings and people who are in the team)
❌	Your team’s page (this page will display information about the team, founders will be able to remove people, assign roles for the project, add project name, add name to the team)
❌	Team edit page (this will also be a module window that will pop-up whenever team’s founder will click on edit button)
❌	Incoming invites (in this page user will be able how many teams invited him, reject or accept invites)
❌	Top team page (on this page user will be able to see statistic of the top team from the ‘top teams tribute page’, members of the team, etc)

We might redesign some pages but for now they should exist in any form, also we might add some additional pages later.

# Team

Regarding the team members as for now:

🧑🏻	George (dev)
🧑🏻	Nikita (dev)
👩🏼	Anastasiia (designer)
👩🏼	Leeza (dev)
🧑🏻	Zhangir (dev, will join later in July)

I think 5 people is enough, even though all of us are juniors, some of us have experience in developing real-world projects. Personally, I believe this idea is amazing and is 1) helping people, 2) could be monetized easily, 3) will give us some real-world experience as students, 4) can potentially give us an opportunity to found company and work on this full-time.

*Once again guys, I don’t want to make any deadlines for now, since I understand that this is a side project for all of us and we probably will be building it slowly, that’s why I invited so many people and probably will invite 1 or 2 more so we can backup each other when some of us will be extremely busy. Also, regarding the roles for this project, if you want to work more on back than on front let me know, same works for other way.*

However, if you want to contribute for both front and back you are more than welcome! Be prepared that this project will be coding-heavy, and you will probably have to learn a lot of new things beside university material so if you are not sure you will have enough time in the future or motivation for it, let me know so I can find someone instead of you (but I really don’t want to do that since I want to work with all of you!!!)

# Design

The plan for now is:

1️⃣	Create design, make 2-3 group calls to decide details (at least clarify points that I mentioned here) and availability to start the project normally. In the same time me and Anastasiia (Nastya in short) will be finalizing desing for missing part and I will start doing the first part which is lending page (I have created some during this summer already so I don’t really need help and can do this by myself, but if you want to help you are more than welcome)
2️⃣	Start writing code for the actual platform, starting from registration/login (this will require research regarding refreshing tokens, JWT authorization, etc.), then do the profiles page, then team page, then create logic to add/remove people from teams, assign roles in team, overall just make the teams logic, then do the tournaments logic and so on.
3️⃣	After the end of development start testing for potential bugs (there will be obviously a lot, but who knows…)
4️⃣	Finally, on this point our job is probably done, then we have to start promoting it which is another story and not really important for now…
Let’s do this, you all are excellent people and programmers and I believe that as a team we will be able to solve all difficulties together and build this product together!

(P.S) Nikita ❤️
