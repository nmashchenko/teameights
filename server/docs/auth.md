## General info

### Auth via email flow

By default boilerplate used sign in and sign up via email and password.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant A as Fronted App (Web, Mobile, Desktop)
    participant B as Backend App

    A->>B: 1. Sign up via email and password
    A->>B: 2. Sign in via email and password
    B->>A: 3. Get a JWT token
    A->>B: 4. Make any requests using a JWT token
```

### Auth via external services or social networks flow

Also you can sign up via another external services or social networks like Google and Github.

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant B as External Auth Services (Google, etc)
    participant A as Fronted App (Web, Mobile, Desktop)
    participant C as Backend App

    A->>B: 1. Sign in through an external service
    B->>A: 2. Get Access Token
    A->>C: 3. Send Access Token to auth endpoint
    C->>A: 4. Get a JWT token
    A->>C: 5. Make any requests using a JWT token
```

For auth with external services or social networks you need:

1. Sign in through an external service and get access token(s).
2. Call one of endpoints with access token received in frontend app on 1-st step and get JWT token from the backend app.

   ```text
   POST /api/v1/auth/google/login
   POST /api/v1/auth/github/login
   ```

3. Make any requests using a JWT token

## Configure Auth

1. Get `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` and `AUTH_REFRESH_SECRET` values from discord

2. Go to `/.env` and replace `AUTH_JWT_SECRET` and `AUTH_REFRESH_SECRET` with output from step 1.

   ```text
   AUTH_JWT_SECRET=HERE_SECRET_KEY_FROM_STEP_1
   AUTH_REFRESH_SECRET=HERE_SECRET_KEY_FROM_STEP_1
   ```


## Auth via Google

1. You need a `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`. You can find these pieces of information by going to the [Developer Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/), clicking your project (if doesn't have create it here https://console.cloud.google.com/projectcreate) -> `APIs & services` -> `credentials`.
2. Change `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` in `.env`

   ```text
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=abc
   GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=abc
   ```

## Refresh token flow

1. On sign in (`POST /api/v1/auth/email/login`) you will receive `token`, `tokenExpires` and `refreshToken` in response.
2. On each regular request you need to send `token` in `Authorization` header.
3. If `token` is expired (check with `tokenExpires` property on client app) you need to send `refreshToken` to `POST /api/v1/auth/refresh` in `Authorization` header to refresh `token`. You will receive new `token`, `tokenExpires` and `refreshToken` in response.

## Logout

1. Call following endpoint:

   ```text
   POST /api/v1/auth/logout
   ```

2. Remove `access token` and `refresh token` from your client app (cookies, localStorage, etc).
